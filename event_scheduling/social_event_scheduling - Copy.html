Event-based Social Networks (EBSN) have become
extremely popular in recent years. In this new type of social
media, users organize, manage and share social events. In conjunction
with EBSNs, several entities such as event planning and
marketing companies, organizations, as well as venues, organize
and manage numerous social events (e.g., festivals, conferences,
parties). A major challenge for event organizers is attracting the
maximum number of participants, since it has great impact on
the success of the event, and, consequently, the expected gains
(e.g., revenue, artist/brand publicity). In this work, we introduce
the Social Event Scheduling (SES) problem, which schedules a set
of social events considering user preferences and behavior, eventsâ€™
spatiotemporal conflicts, and competing events, in order to
maximize the overall number of participants.
In short, given a set of events, a set of time periods and
a set of users, our objective is to determine how to assign events
on the time periods, so that the maximum participant enrollment is
achieved.
